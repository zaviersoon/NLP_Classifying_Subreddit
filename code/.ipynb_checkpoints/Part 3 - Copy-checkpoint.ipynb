    "#### 4.3.1 Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression** is considered a standard approach for binary classification. Logistic Regression uses an equation as the representation, very much like Linear Regression. Input values (X) are combined linearly using weights or coefficient values to predict an output value (y). A key difference from Linear Regression is that the output value being modeled is a binary values (0 or 1) rather than a numeric value. It is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train. The model coefficients can be interpreted as indicators of feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The major limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Non-linear problems can’t be solved with Logistic Regression. Also, if the number of observations is lesser than the number of features, it may lead to overfitting."

    "1. Based on the above information, I conclude that both **Logistic Regression with CountVectorizer** and **Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer** model is slightly overfit to the data but is not a bad model.\n",
    "2. Here, True Negatives(TN) are <mark style=\"background-color: lightgrey\">r/aliens</mark> posts that were correctly classified by our model. True Positives(TP) are <mark style=\"background-color: lightgrey\">r/space</mark> posts that were correctly classified by our model.\n",
    "3. Based on the R2 accuracy, Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer model R2 accuracy is higher than Logistic Regression with CountVectorizer model. Logistic Regression with CountVectorizer model is able to accurately predict 87.4% of the the test data and 98.2% of the train data based on our text features whereas Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer model is able to accurately predict 89.3% of the the test data and 97.5% of the train data based on our text features. Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer model is quite good and less overfit.\n",
    "4. F1-score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. F1-score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. High F1-score indicate a good Precision and a good Recall score. Based on F1-score, Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer is higher than Logistic Regression with CountVectorizer model.\n",
    "5. CountVectorizer is a way to convert a given set of strings into a frequency representation. TF-IDF Vectorizer means Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency that is based on the frequency of a word in the corpus but it also provides a numerical representation of how important a word is for statistical analysis. TF-IDF Vectorizer is better than CountVectorizer. "

    "**Naive Bayes** is a learning algorithm frequently used in text classification problems. Naive Bayes algorithm is divided into threre types namely **Bernoulli**, **Multinomial** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes**. Bernoulli is a binary algorithm used when the feature is present or not. On the other hand, Multinomial Naive Bayes consider a feature vector where a given term represents the number of times it appears or very often i.e. frequency. At last Gaussian is based on continuous distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes is a suitable algorithm to use in our analysis. Multinomial Naive Bayes has low computation cost and work effectively with large datasets. Also, it is easy to implement, fast and accurate method of prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major limitation of Multinomial Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. This algorithm assumes that all the attributes are mutually independent. In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent. Also, it is only used for textual data classification and cannot be used to predict numeric values."

Based on the R2 accuracy, Multinomial Naive Bayes with CountVectorizer model and Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF Vectorizer model is only a marginal difference with Multinomial Naive Bayes with CountVectorizer model lesser overfit. Multinomial Naive Bayes with CountVectorizer model is able to accurately predict 87.7% of the the test data and 95.5% of the train data based on our text features. However, Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF Vectorizer model is able to accurately predict only 88.3% of the the test data, given the fact that it able to accurately predict 97.1% of the train data based on our text features. Both model is good and acceptable.\n",

    "**Random Forests** is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees. It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree. Random Forests reduces overfitting in decision trees and helps to improve the accuracy. Also, it is flexible to both classification and regression problems and works well with both categorical and continuous values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major limitation of Random Forests is it requires much computational power as well as resources as it builds numerous trees to combine their outputs. It also requires much time for training as it combines a lot of decision trees to determine the class. Last but not least, due to the ensemble of decision trees, it suffers interpretability and fails to determine the significance of each variable."

Random Forests with CountVectorizer model is able to accurately predict 87.0% of the the test data and 99.7% of the train data based on our text features wheras Random Forests with TF-IDF Vectorizer model is able to accurately predict 86.0% of the the test data and 99.7% of the train data based on our text features.

    "1. Based on the above summary table, all the model R2 accuracy & F1-score is only marginal difference. Model with text vectorized using TF-IDF Vectorizer tends to perform slightly better than CountVectorizer except Random Forests model. Hyperparameter tuning (optimization) is an essential aspect of machine learning process of maximizing a model's performance without overfitting or creating too high of a variance. \n",
    "2. In view of the fact that Random forests is slow in generating predictions because it has multiple decision trees. Whenever it makes a prediction, all the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same given input and then perform voting on it. This whole process is time-consuming. Random forests model will be excluded from hyperparameter tuning process.\n",
    "3. Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train for predicting real-time applications. Thus, both model will go through hyperparameter tuning."

    "3. AUC-ROC curve is another evaluation metric for binary classification problems. It is a probability curve that plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold values. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve. The higher the AUC, the better the performance of the model at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes. Based on AUC-ROC curve, all models are pretty close. However, Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer model outperforming other models at most decision thresholds, apart from the start of the curve and the end of the curve. \n",

    "1.  These are the strong predicting features that can be used to classify whether a post belongs to <mark style=\"background-color: lightgrey\">r/aliens</mark> or <mark style=\"background-color: lightgrey\">r/space</mark>.   \n",
    "2. In linear regression the y variable is continuous (i.e. has an infinite set of possibilities). In logistic regression the y variable is categorical(binary), but use of the logit function allows the y variable to be treated as continuous.\n",
    "3. In either linear or logistic regression, each X variable’s effect on the y variable is expressed in the X variable’s coefficient. Though both models’ coefficients look similar, they need to be interpreted in very different ways.\n",
    "4. Interpreting linear regression coefficients is fairly straightforward, and can be verbally describe the coefficients like this: “For every one-unit increase in [X variable], the [y variable] increases by [coefficient] when all other variables are held constant.”\n",
    "5. However, logistic regression coefficients aren’t as easily interpreted. This is because logistic regression uses the logit link function to “bend” our line of best fit and convert our classification problem into a regression problem. Because of the logit function, logistic regression coefficients represent the log odds that an observation is in the target class (“1”) given the values of its X variables. Thus, these log odd coefficients need to be converted to regular odds in order to make sense of them. Happily, this is done by simply exponentiating the log odds coefficients. Now these coefficients can be verbally describe the odds coefficients like this: “For every one-unit increase in [X variable], the odds that the observation is in (y class) are [coefficient] times as large as the odds that the observation is not in (y class) when all other variables are held constant.”\n",
    "6. For example: as variable **space** increases by one unit, the odds that the subreddit represented in the observation are in the target class (\"1\") over 13x as large as the odds that they won't be in the target class. On the other hand, as variable **alien** increases by one unit, the odds that the subreddit are in the target class are 0.018. For odds less than 1 (our negative coefficients), we can take 1/odds to make even better sense of them. So as variable alien increases by one unit, the odds that the subreddit is NOT in the target class are 1/0.018 or 55x  as likely as the odds that IS in the target class."
